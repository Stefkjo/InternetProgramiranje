<!--Write a program in which the user, through a prompt, enters the number of books needed. -->
<!--After that, they need to enter the properties of each book: title (string), author (string), -->
<!--and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating whether the book has been read or not). -->
<!--An array of objects should be created, where each object represents a single book. -->
<!--The program should then iterate through all the objects in the array, and for each object, print the -->
<!--title of the book, the author, and, based on whether it has been read or not, display the appropriate message.-->
<!--Additionally, the books should be sorted by the author's name.-->
